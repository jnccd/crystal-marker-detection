abstract = {This review provides an insight into the recent developments of photonic crystal (PhC)-based devices for sensing and imaging, with a particular emphasis on biosensors. We focus on two main classes of devices, namely sensors based on PhC cavities and those on guided mode resonances (GMRs). This distinction is able to capture the richness of possibilities that PhCs are able to offer in this space. We present recent examples highlighting applications where PhCs can offer new capabilities, open up new applications or enable improved performance, with a clear emphasis on the different types of structures and photonic functions. We provide a critical comparison between cavity-based devices and GMR devices by highlighting strengths and weaknesses. We also compare PhC technologies and their sensing mechanism to surface plasmon resonance, microring resonators and integrated interferometric sensors.}

abstract = {Two border following algorithms are proposed for the topological analysis of digitized binary images. The first one determines the surroundness relations among the borders of a binary image. Since the outer borders and the hole borders have a one-to-one correspondence to the connected components of 1-pixels and to the holes, respectively, the proposed algorithm yields a representation of a binary image, from which one can extract some sort of features without reconstructing the image. The second algorithm, which is a modified version of the first, follows only the outermost borders (i.e., the outer borders which are not surrounded by holes). These algorithms can be effectively used in component counting, shrinking, and topological structural analysis of binary images, when a sequential digital computer is used.}

ABSTRACT = {Data augmentation is a commonly used technique for increasing both the size and the diversity of labeled training sets by leveraging input transformations that preserve corresponding output labels. In computer vision, image augmentations have become a common implicit regularization technique to combat overfitting in deep learning models and are ubiquitously used to improve performance. While most deep learning frameworks implement basic image transformations, the list is typically limited to some variations of flipping, rotating, scaling, and cropping. Moreover, image processing speed varies in existing image augmentation libraries. We present Albumentations, a fast and flexible open source library for image augmentation with many various image transform operations available that is also an easy-to-use wrapper around other augmentation libraries. We discuss the design principles that drove the implementation of Albumentations and give an overview of the key features and distinct capabilities. Finally, we provide examples of image augmentations for different computer vision tasks and demonstrate that Albumentations is faster than other commonly used image augmentation tools on most image transform operations.},
