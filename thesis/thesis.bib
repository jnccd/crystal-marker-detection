abstract = {Automatic layout algorithms are commonly used when displaying graphs on the screen because they provide a “nice” drawing of the graph without user intervention. There are, however, a couple of disadvantages to automatic layout. Without user intervention, an automatic layout algorithm is only capable of producing an aesthetically pleasing drawing of the graph. User- or application-specified layout constraints (often concerning the semantics of a graph) are difficult or impossible to specify. A second problem is that automatic layout algorithms seldom make use of information in the current layout when calculating the new layout. This can also be frustrating to the user because whenever a new layout is done, the user's orientation in the graph is lost.This paper suggests using layout constraints to solve both of these problems. We show how user-specified layout constraints may be easily added to many automatic graph layout algorithms. Additionally, the constraints specified by the current layout are used when calculating the new layout to achieve a more stable layout. This approach allows a continuum between manual and automatic layout by allowing the user to specify how stable the graph's layout should be.},

We apply our methods to dataflow diagrams from practical applications and find that the first method significantly reduces the width of left-to-right drawn diagrams. The second method allows to properly arrange disconnected graphs that have hierarchy-crossing edges.",

abstract="The visualization of graphs is a key component for many applications in science and engineering. When drawing a graph, we would like to take into account several aesthetic criteria. For example, planarity and the display of symmetries are often highly desirable in visualization applications. Also, to avoid wasting space on the screen, it is important to keep the area of the drawing small, subject to resolution rules. Further, it is desirable to avoid as much as possible long edges with bends.",

abstract={Most current graph layout technology does not lend itself to interactive applications such as animation or advanced user interfaces. We introduce the constrained graph layout model which is better suited for interactive applications. In this model, input to the layout module includes suggested positions for nodes and constraints over the node positions in the graph to be laid out. We describe four implementations of layout modules which are based on the constrained graph layout model. The first three implementations are for undirected graph layout while the fourth is for tree layout. The implementations use active set techniques to solve the layout. Our empirical evaluation shows that they are quite fast and give reasonable layout.},

abstract = "Graph layout algorithms typically conform to one or more aesthetic criteria (e.g. minimizing the number of bends, maximizing orthogonality). Determining the extent to which a graph drawing conforms to an aesthetic criterion tends to be done informally, and varies between different algorithms. This paper presents formal metrics for measuring the aesthetic presence in a graph drawing for seven common aesthetic criteria, applicable to any graph drawing of any size. The metrics are useful for determining the aesthetic quality of a given graph drawing, or for defining a cost function for genetic algorithms or simulated annealing programs. The metrics are continuous, so that aesthetic quality is not stated as a binary conformance decision (i.e. the drawing either conforms to the aesthetic or not), but can be stated as the extent of aesthetic conformance using a number between 0 and 1. The paper presents the seven metric formulae. The application of these metrics is demonstrated through the aesthetic analysis of example graph drawings produced by common layout algorithms."
